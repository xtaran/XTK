Preface
-------

This repository contains more or less all my designs, thoughts,
braindumps and crazy ideas around keyboard layout design.
("XTK" is short for "XTaran's Keyboard(s)")

The layouts were usually created in the online [Keyboard Layout
Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) and the JSON format it
produces can be consumed by many other tools from the mechanical
keyboard scene.
