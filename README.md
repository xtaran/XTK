XTKb: 45% and 50% Keyboard Designs
==================================

(short for "XTaran's Keyboards")

Incentives
----------

* Four rows of keys only (40% style)
* Though all common columns including brackets, single/double quotes,
  backslash/pipe. → more 50% than 40%
* Dedicated arrow keys in turned-over-T layout.
* Either HHKB layout or additional column with
  Home/PageUp/PageDown/End.
* Should probably support both, single or split spacebar.
* Running free software ([QMK](https://qmk.fm/)) as firmware.

### Dropped requirements

* [GMK Paperwork](https://thevankeyboards.com/products/paperwork)
  compatibility
    * Misses the bracket and backslash/pipe keys anyway.
    * The HHKB variant comes close, but there's no 2u Shift in GMK
      Paperwork included. Might be compensated with a 1u shift plus
      another 1u key.

Intended features
-----------------

* Kailh hotswap sockets with PCB-mount support — if this is every
  growing out of the handwired state.

Layouts
-------

All the JSON files are made with and meant for the [online Keyboard
Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/). The images are
made with it, too.

To generate the files needed to produce the plates, you might want to
use [Will Steven's Online Plate & Case
Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/).

Inspirations
------------

### HHKB-style Keyboards With Dedicated Cursor Keys

Similar Keyboards
-----------------

… but not really inspirations.

* [Don Park's Slim 55%
  Layout](https://www.keebtalk.com/t/slim-55-layout/6771) (very
  similar in size, but with different incentives; learned of it only
  after I made my designs initially)
* [TKC CandyBar](https://thekey.company/collections/candybar) (40%
  plus number block; so a 50% to 55% layout, too, but very different
  ideas; ordered one)
* [DDmicro](https://kbdfans.com/blogs/news/ddmicro-wireless-keyboard)
  (a 40% with potentially dedicated cursor keys, and hence close, but
  without the additional column and unfortunately wireless — and sold
  out; heard and forgot about it before I did my designs and after I
  showed my designs around, someone made me aware of it again.)

#### HHKB-style 40% Keyboards

Basically any 40% HHKB-style keyboard is similar to the HHKB-variant
of my design.

* [Neuron](https://www.keebtalk.com/t/ic-neuron-hhkb-40/6894)
* [Pearl](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=92259.0)
* [Daisy HHKB-variant](https://kprepublic.com/products/anodized-aluminium-case-for-daisy-40-hhkb-layout-custom-keyboard-acrylic-diffuser-can-support-daisy)

Thanks
------

* Ermel for the idea of the project name "XTKb".
* Stephan for reminding me of the DDmicro.
