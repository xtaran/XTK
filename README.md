Yet Unnamed 55% Keyboard Layout
===============================

Incentives
----------

* Four rows of keys only (40% style)
* Though all common columns including brackets, single/double quotes,
  backslash/pipe. → more 50% than 40%
* Dedicated arrow keys in turned-over-T layout.
* Either HHKB layout or additional column with
  Home/PageUp/PageDown/End.
* Should probably support both, single or split spacebar.
* Running free software ([QMK](https://qmk.fm/)) as firmware.

Intended features
-----------------

* Kailh hotswap sockets with PCB-mount support — if this is every
  growing out of the handwired state.
