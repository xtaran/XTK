XTKb: 45% and 50% Keyboard Designs
==================================

(short for "XTaran's Keyboards")

Incentives
----------

* Four rows of keys only (40% style)
* Though all common columns including brackets, single/double quotes,
  backslash/pipe. → more 50% than 40%
* Dedicated arrow keys in turned-over-T layout.
* Either HHKB layout or additional column with
  Home/PageUp/PageDown/End.
* Should probably support both, single or split spacebar.
* Running free software ([QMK](https://qmk.fm/)) as firmware.

### Dropped requirements

* [GMK Paperwork](https://thevankeyboards.com/products/paperwork)
  compatibility
    * Misses the bracket and backslash/pipe keys anyway.
    * The HHKB variant comes close, but there's no 2u Shift in GMK
      Paperwork included. Might be compensated with a 1u shift plus
      another 1u key.

Intended features
-----------------

* Kailh hotswap sockets with PCB-mount support — if this is every
  growing out of the handwired state.

Layouts
-------

All the JSON files are made with and meant for the [online Keyboard
Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/). The images are
made with it, too.

To generate the files needed to produce the plates, you might want to
use [Will Steven's Online Plate & Case
Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/).
