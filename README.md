Preface
-------

This repository contains more or less all my designs, thoughts,
braindumps and crazy ideas around keyboard layout design.
("XTK" is short for "XTaran's Keyboard(s)")

The layouts were usually created in the online [Keyboard Layout
Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) and the JSON format it
produces can be consumed by many other tools from the mechanical
keyboard scene.

* Ermel for helping on my way to find a proper project name. The name
  under which I initially published this, "XTKb", was his idea (though
  with different capitalization) after I wasn't happy that my idea
  "XTK" was already in use quite often. At some point I though decided
  that I'll use "XTK" anyway as "X Tool Kit" is definitely a different
  type of thing, so after a while I switched to this initial idea.
* Stephan for reminding me of the DDmicro.
* Marcel for remembering where I saw that Pro Micro comparison.
